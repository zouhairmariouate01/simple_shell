0x16. C - Simple Shell
The ALX team's second project, titled "Simple Shell," initially involved collaboration between two teammates. But for unexpected personal reasons, she quietly withdrew from the project without offering any explanations or excuses. After that, I took full responsibility for completing the project independently, acting as the sole contributor. Interestingly, when I later called my colleague and inquired about our collaborative work on the project, he claimed to have no knowledge of our joint involvement and insisted that I was working with him.
